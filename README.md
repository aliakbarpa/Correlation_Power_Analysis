# Correlation_Power_Analysis
Side Channel Attack (SCA)
Thanks to the Reference= http://dpabook.iaik.tugraz.at/
This is the demonstration of CPA attack on AES algorithm
The file contains power dissipation measurement on the last round of AES algorithm and successfully break all 16 bytes keys
You may change the measurement file at Attack.mat--> traces and also the leakage model in Attack.mat-->input
you can just run the key.mat and plot the result
Example: plot(key1)
Thanks
